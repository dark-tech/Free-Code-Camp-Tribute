            <h2>
                Early life
            </h2>

            <p>
                Tecson was born in San Miguel de Mayumo, Bulacan, one of sixteen children of Rafael Tecson and Monica Perez.[2] She learned to read and write from schoolmaster Quinto. She practiced fencing with Juan Zeto and was feared throughout the province, called "Tangkad" (tall) by her peers. Orphaned at a very young age, she stopped school and went with her siblings to live with relatives. She married at 19 and had two children, Sinforoso and Desiderio, who both died. Tecson and her husband were engaged in the purchase and sale of cattle, fish and oysters.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Revolutionary
            </h2>

            <p>
                At first she was a dedicated councilor of Logia de Adopcion, a masonic lodge founded in 1893 for Philippine women. In 1895 at the age of 47 she joined the Katipunan, signing her oath with her own blood, although women members were not required to do so. She helped the group by pilfering firearms from a courthouse in Caloocan and in San Isidro. She was working under General Mariano Llanera when the Revolution began. In a battle in San Miguel, she was almost captured while delivering food to the soldiers, but escaped by pretending to be dead. She took part in a battle led by General Francisco Macabulos of Tarlac, General Llanera, Gen. Isidro Torres and Gen. Gregorio del Pilar of Bulacan. On the battlefield, she tended to the wounded Katipuneros. In the bloody battle of San Miguel and Zaragosa she was shot in her right thigh. Tecson and the others were forced to retreat to Biak-na-Bato, which became the revolutionary headquarters of Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo.
            </p>
            
            <h2>
                Philippine-American War
            </h2>

            <p>
                She joined the revolutionary forces led by Gen. Gregorio del Pilar and participated in the assault on the province of Bulacan and Calumpit. She also served in the Malolos Republic and was designated as the Commissary of War. During the American drive northward, she was in Cabanatuan. Bringing with her sick and wounded revolutionaries, Tecson crossed the Zambales mountains to Santa Cruz then to Iba.
